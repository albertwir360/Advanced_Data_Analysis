# Advanced Data Analysis
### Objective
This repository will contain work pertaining to the usage of SAS programming language to assess several data sets statistically. In this way, a strong understanding of the programming language is established while building a strong intuiton on predictice analytics. Much of this work is derived from UIUC's STAT 448: Advanced Data Analysis Course.
